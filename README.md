# ATLGameday

"Is there a game today?"

This is a simple site to display whether an event is taking place at one of the sports venues near downtown Atlanta, and what traffic looks like in the area (via [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/)).

I know what you're thinking: "Is a PostgreSQL database and full Django framework really necessary for a single table of data?"

The answer is no. It's definitely overkill. But I wanted to learn to create and deploy a site with Django and it seemed a good idea to start simple.
